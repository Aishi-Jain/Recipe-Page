## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

This is the code snippet for how i styles the bullet points of the list items: 

```css
li {
    padding-left: 15px;
}

ul, ol {
    padding-left: 12px;
    margin-left: 12px;
}

ul li::marker {
    color: var(--dark-raspberry);
    font-size: 13.5px;
}
```

### Continued development

I aim to learn more about CSS styles and hopefully use CSS frameworks to style this page even better in the future!
